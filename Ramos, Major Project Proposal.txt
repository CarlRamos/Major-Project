Major Project proposal

Carl Ramos

In the major project I plan to make a 2D Real time strategy game where you have full control of your units and you can tell them to build unique buildings. I decided 
to make an rts game because I think it would be challenging and fun to make, especially the AI. I plan to make this by finishing the skeleton of the game (buildings, selecting unit and
making them move, collision detection, etc.) before the christmas, after that I plan to work on the break on making the units harvest and adding enemies etc. and lastly I would work on
graphics and sounds to make the game better. 

TimeLine:

//////////Done before christmas break\\\\\\\\\
	
	basic ui	
	buildings
	random map(with random resources)
	selecting unit and making it move
	spawning units

///////work on christmas break\\\\\\\	
	
	unit behaviour(if attacking, harvesting building)
	collision detection
	improve ui
